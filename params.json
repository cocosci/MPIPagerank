PageRank calculates a numerical value for each element of a hyperlinked set of webpages, which reflects the probability that a random surfer will access that page. The process of PageRank can be modeled as a Markov Chain which requires iterative calculations to converge. An iteration of PageRank calculates the new access probability for each webpage based on values calculated in the previous iteration. The process will repeat until the number of current iterations is bigger than predefined maximum iterations, or the Euclidian distance between rank values in two subsequent iterations is less than a predefined threshold that controls the accuracy of the output results. In MPJ-PageRank, we extend previous work on sequential PageRank algorithm to the parallel version via input partition and message passing functionalities.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAuthors: Kai Zhen, Mridul Birla\r\nzhenk@umail.iu.edu, mbirla@umail.iu.edu\r\nSchool of informatics and computing, Indiana University\r\n```\r\n\r\n# How to compile and run\r\n\r\njavac -cp .:$MPJ_HOME/lib/mpj.jar MPIPageRank.java \r\n\r\nmpjrun.sh -np 4 MPIPageRank input.txt out.txt 1000 0.85\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Result\r\n\r\n```\r\n[zhenk@silo src]$ mpjrun.sh -np 4 MPIPageRank input.txt out.txt 1000 0.85 \r\nPicked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Xms512m -Xmx512m\r\nMPJ Express (0.44) is started in the multicore configuration\r\nPicked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Xms512m -Xmx512m\r\nFor Process Rank 0:\r\nRunning time for loading for :13ms\r\nRunning time for calculation:1524ms\r\nFor Process Rank 2:\r\nRunning time for loading for :119ms\r\nRunning time for calculation:1418ms\r\nFor Process Rank 3:\r\nRunning time for loading for :118ms\r\nRunning time for calculation:1418ms\r\nFor Process Rank 1:\r\nRunning time for loading for :116ms\r\nRunning time for calculation:1417ms\r\n1 :-  0.38440094881355413\r\n2 :-  0.34291028550837954\r\n4 :-  0.08088569323449774\r\n3 :-  0.039087092099966095\r\n5 :-  0.039087092099966095\r\n0 :-  0.03278149315934399\r\n6 :-  0.016169479016858404\r\n7 :-  0.016169479016858404\r\n8 :-  0.016169479016858404\r\n9 :-  0.016169479016858404\r\n```\r\n",
